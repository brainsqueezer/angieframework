Angie is web application framework written in PHP5 that lets you create database driven web applications
in a metter of days instead of a matter of weeks and months. Key concepts used in Angie:

1. Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern used to separate key application elements
2. Framework behaviour can be changed easily. You don't like how folders are structured in your application?
   You'd like to use some other persistance library or template engine? Angie will let you change them through
   the documented and supported interface, not through hacks
